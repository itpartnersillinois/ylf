## Middle Grades Education major

Trey Harris is a Golden Apple Scholar who is passionate about the world of education and teaching. Golden Apple prepares (and helps support through tuition assistance) high school seniors and first- and second-year Illinois college students who have the determination and drive to be excellent teachers.

He worked in Chicago Public Schools with their summer school programs, helping students who struggled during the school year to move forward into the next grade.

"This was such an eye-opening experience for me, seeing the many students that Chicago Public Schools serve. I enjoyed being a positive role model to look up to, and I hope they could see themselves doing some of the things I do. I want to be that mentor that shows them that it isn’t always about where you start, but how you finish." {.blockquote-small}
