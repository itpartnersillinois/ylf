## Literature is at the heart of our lives

The mission of The **Youth Literature Festival** is to place literature, and all the arts, at the heart of youths' lives. Started by the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008, the event celebrates the value of literature in the lives of youth by bringing together nationally known authors, illustrators, poets, and storytellers to share their stories, their craft, and their enthusiasm for books with children and teens.

The Festival, held every two years since 2008, leads off with authors visiting numerous area schools. The popular and free-to-the-public Community Day celebration caps the event. Festivities during Community Day include author presentations and panels, hands-on activities, puppetry, storytelling, and musical performances.
