## Community Day Entertainment

### Banks Bridgewater Lewis (BBL) Fine Arts Academy Performance

![BBL Fine Arts Academy Performance](/img/community/bbl-1.jpg)

This group started in 2005 as "Mo' Betta Music After School Academy," a faith-based collaboration between two community leaders from Bethel A.M.E. Church, Salem Baptist Church, and several University of Illinois programming units. 

Now, Banks Bridgewater Lewis Fine Arts Academy (BBL Fine Arts Academy). The name change reflects a vision for an expanded arts academy that is inclusive of drama, dance, and visual arts. The names also honors members of the community who have supported this group from the early stages: Carrie Banks, Erma Bridgewater, and Rosalind Lewis.

The objective is to offer jazz and popular music enrichment activities that encourage school age, low-income students in upper elementary through high school of all races, genders, and economic statuses to strive for excellence so they can participate and compete in their local school bands and choirs.

### Centro LCV Capoeira

![Centro LCV Capoeira](/img/community/capoeira-angola-lcv-3.jpg)

Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art developed by Africans in Brazil during the period of slavery. Unique fighting styles from various regions of Africa merged in Brazil and became Capoeira. Because the enslaved people were not allowed to openly practice combat techniques, they concealed the fight as a dance or game by incorporating musical instruments and call and response songs. In Urbana-Champaign, this cultural experience can be found at the Capoeira Angola Center of Mestre João Grande Study Group led by Denis Chiaramonte. Originally from São Paulo, Brazil, Chiaramonte has more than 25 years of experience training with a series of esteemed Brazilian masters.
