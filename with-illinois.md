## ![With Illinois](/img/with-illinois.png) How to Invest in College of Education Students

**Individual Retirement Account Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)**. At age 72, owners of qualified retirement accounts are required to take an RMD from their retirement funds. Donors can transfer to a qualified charity, such  as the College of Education, up to $100,000 annually.

**Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT)**. A CRUT is a giving vehicle that provides a donor with an income tax deduction as well as provides income to named beneficiary(ies) for their lifetime or a term of years. After the terms of the trust expire, the remainder value can benefit the College of Education.

A **Pledge** is a promise to pay a specified amount over a set period. For example, a donor might pledge $25,000 to create a scholarship in the College of Education to be paid over five years, by installments.

**Estate Gifts**. These gifts are popular as they ensure you have the resources you need during your lifetime and then afterwards provides a meaningful gift for the benefit of the College of Education.  These gifts can be setup through a will, living trust or a beneficiary designation.

**Payroll Deduction**. Many donors choose to give to their charity of choice through a payroll deduction. A charitable payroll deduction allows a donor to “spread” their gift out over the course of several years.
